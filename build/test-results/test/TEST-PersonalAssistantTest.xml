  <system-out><![CDATA[Hello! My name is Alien.
I was created in 2019.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, Marry!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is 40; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!
6!
7!
8!
9!
10!
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To Interrupt the execution of a program.
Please, try again.
Congratulations, have a nice day!
